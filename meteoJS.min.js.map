The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however\n * settable. There are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For\n * example, `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\n *\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

The layer will not be\n * rendered outside of this extent.\n * @property {number} [zIndex] The z-index for layer rendering.  At rendering time, the layers\n * will be ordered, first by Z-index and then by position. When `undefined`, a `zIndex` of 0 is assumed\n * for layers that are added to the map's `layers` collection, or `Infinity` when the layer's `setMap()`\n * method was used.\n * @property {number} [minResolution] The minimum resolution (inclusive) at which this layer will be\n * visible.\n * @property {number} [maxResolution] The maximum resolution (exclusive) below which this layer will\n * be visible.\n * @property {number} [minZoom] The minimum view zoom level (exclusive) above which this layer will be\n * visible.\n * @property {number} [maxZoom] The maximum view zoom level (inclusive) at which this layer will\n * be visible.\n * @property {import(\"../render.js\").OrderFunction} [renderOrder] Render order. Function to be used when sorting\n * features before rendering. By default features are drawn in the order that they are created. Use\n * `null` to avoid the sort, but get an undefined draw order.\n * @property {number} [renderBuffer=100] The buffer in pixels around the tile extent used by the\n * renderer when getting features from the vector tile for the rendering or hit-detection.\n * Recommended value: Vector tiles are usually generated with a buffer, so this value should match\n * the largest possible buffer of the used tiles. It should be at least the size of the largest\n * point symbol or line width.\n * @property {import(\"./VectorTileRenderType.js\").default|string} [renderMode='hybrid'] Render mode for vector tiles:\n *  * `'image'`: Vector tiles are rendered as images. Great performance, but point symbols and texts\n *    are always rotated with the view and pixels are scaled during zoom animations. When `declutter`\n *    is set to `true`, the decluttering is done per tile resulting in labels and point symbols getting\n *    cut off at tile boundaries.\n *  * `'hybrid'`: Polygon and line elements are rendered as images, so pixels are scaled during zoom\n *    animations. Point symbols and texts are accurately rendered as vectors and can stay upright on\n *    rotated views.\n *  * `'vector'`: Everything is rendered as vectors. Use this mode for improved performance on vector\n *    tile layers with only a few rendered features (e.g. for highlighting a subset of features of\n *    another layer with the same source).\n * @property {import(\"../source/VectorTile.js\").default} [source] Source.\n * @property {import(\"../PluggableMap.js\").default} [map] Sets the layer as overlay on a map. The map will not manage\n * this layer in its layers collection, and the layer will be rendered on top. This is useful for\n * temporary layers. The standard way to add a layer to a map and have it managed by the map is to\n * use {@link module:ol/Map#addLayer}.\n * @property {boolean} [declutter=false] Declutter images and text. Decluttering is applied to all\n * image and text styles of all Vector and VectorTile layers that have set this to `true`. The priority\n * is defined by the z-index of the layer, the `zIndex` of the style and the render order of features.\n * Higher z-index means higher priority. Within the same z-index, a feature rendered before another has\n * higher priority.\n * @property {import(\"../style/Style.js\").StyleLike} [style] Layer style. See\n * {@link module:ol/style} for default style which will be used if this is not defined.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileAnimating=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will be\n * recreated during animations. This means that no vectors will be shown clipped, but the setting\n * will have a performance impact for large amounts of vector data. When set to `false`, batches\n * will be recreated when no animation is active.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileInteracting=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will be\n * recreated during interactions.
